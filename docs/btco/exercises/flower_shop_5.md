Sally wants to print a small booklet containing information about the flowers she's selling. 

Create a report on `sale.order` that compiles the information of each flower present in the current order. 

#### To-Do's:

- Report's paper size should be 7.5 x 7.5 cm
- The first page should display the company name
- Each flower should start in a new page
- Each flower page should print all the fields/attributes of the flower
