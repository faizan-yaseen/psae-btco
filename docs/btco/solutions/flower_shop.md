# Sally's Flower Shop - Part 1

The first step is to create a new module inside of the project folder. To do this, create a new folder for the module
and ensure that it contains `__init__.py` and `__manifest__.py`. Alternatively, we can use the [scaffolder](https://www.odoo.com/documentation/15.0/developer/cli.html#scaffolding)
to automate the creation of the module.

We shall name our module `the_flower_app`.
