# Sally's Flower Shop - Part 2

Sally is now ready to sell her flowers. Modify the app you have previously written for her in a way that enables her to 
be able to use the flowers within sale order lines.

#### To-Do's:
- Add a boolean to differentiate between normal products and flowers
- Keep flowers in a different menu item
- Make sure that products that are created from the flowers-only menu item window action are set to be flowers by default
- In sale order lines, only show products that are flowers
