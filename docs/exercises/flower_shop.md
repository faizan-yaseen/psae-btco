# Sally's Flower Shop - Part 1

Sally runs a flower shop. She wants to use Odoo in order to run her daily tasks smoothly. 
This store grows its own flowers in a garden nearby. These flowers have a set of different attributes.

Help Sally by creating an app that includes a list of flowers.

Each flower has the following attributes:
- Common name
- Scientific name
- Season (hint: use 2 date fields)
- Watering frequency (example: watering frequency = 3 ==> should be watered once every 3 days)
- Watering amount (in milliliters)
